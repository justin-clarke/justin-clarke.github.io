		<h3>Software Vulnerabilities And Exploits</h3>

		<p>The term “hacking” refers to using a system or program in a way other than what was intended. There is nothing magic about it. It simply entails using unexpected behavior to put the system in a state the designer did not anticipate, and using that state to perform the actions the attacker desires.</p>

		<p>Most attacks in the past have targeted systems exposed to the wider internet. Over time companies have made it more difficult to access their systems from outside their network, or “hardened their perimeter.” This has led to an increase in the targeting of users within an organization through phishing or social engineering attacks. One an attacker gets control of a machine inside an organization’s network they can use it to launch an attack on the rest of the network from within. This generally entails targeting a user’s browser.</p>

		<p> Computer systems have multiple types of vulnerabilities including configuration vulnerabilities, logic vulnerabilities, storage vulnerabilities, and input validation vulnerabilities. There are different ways to exploit each type of vulnerability, and each method requires a different type of access to the user’s system.</p>

		<p>Configuration vulnerabilities refer to mistakes made by the user, such as using weak passwords or choosing to disable the security measures on their machine. Logic vulnerabilities refer to authorization issues or failure to properly protect sensitive parts of a program. Storage vulnerabilities result from inadequate encryption of stored data. Input validation vulnerabilities result when a user is able to corrupt memory or launch a code injection attack.</p>

		<p>WinDbg, or “win debug” is a program that allows user’s to freeze execution of a given program and interact with it and examine the state at any point in the execution. It is similar to gdb, but for windows processes. The user can set break points, step into or over function calls and examine variable values and locations in memory.</p>

		<p>WinDbg must be attached to a specific process before you can control execution and analyze any results. All numbers appear in hexadecimal format. Below are some common and useful commands:</p>

		<ul>
  			<li>lm - list modules</li>
			<li>lmf m [string] - searches (can use wildcards)</li>
			<li>bp simpleStackAndHeap!main - set breakpoint at main function</li>
			<li>bl - lists breakpoints</li>
			<li>g - go to next breakpoint</li>
			<li>dd - display a d word of memory (i.e. dd eax shows values in eax. dd poi(esp) treats the value in esp as a pointer)</li>
			<li>u - unassembled</li>
			<li>formats [value] - list different formats for the given value (i.e. !formats 11)</li>
			<li>db - show local variables</li>
			<li>.hh - help system</li>
			<li>da - display as an ascii string</li>
			<li>du - display a unicode string</li>
			<li>t - take a step into next function (t 5 means take 5 steps)</li>
			<li>p - step over (p b executes 11 instructions since b = 11 in hex)</li>
			<li>g [addr] - go to a particular address</li>
			<li>pt - execute until return</li>
			<li>r - views registers (r eip gives value in eip)</li>
			<li>!teb - stack (stack base and limit are the beginning and end of stack. specific for thread) Stack base and stack limit are total size of stack</li>
			<li>!peb - heap (specific for the process)</li> 
			<li>!address - says what section the address is in (stack, heap, etc.) (!address psi)</li>
			<li>k - show call stack</li>
			<li>!byakugan: will load a program that will read registers and tell you the offset of each one using a non repeating string from metasploit</li> 
			<li>!heap -p -a eax - gives information about the heap  (-p means page heap, -a means address, eax asked about that register)</li>
			<li>!heap -stat - gives details about all the heap handles (first one is default process heap)</li>
			<li>!heap -flt -s [size] - searches for all allocations of a given size</li>
			<li>~ - show threads</li>
			<li>!threads - gives details about each thread</li>
			<li>u eip L10 - the value subtracted from esp is the size of the variables</li>
			<li>q - quit</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Another important tool is metasploit. Metasploit is an open source collection of payloads of known exploits that can be used when testing a system’s defensive capabilities or when developing new exploits.</p>

		<p>In order to exploit a vulnerability it is necessary to trigger the vulnerability to gain control of the program. This usually causes the program to go into a state that is an edge condition. For example, it may involve input that causes a series of JavaScript calls. At that point a hacker will deliver their payload, which is what executes the malicious code. Usually, the payload is in the form of assembly code that executes a shell script. A common example for demonstration is launching the calculator from internet explorer.</p>

		<p>Memory corruption consists of “accessing memory (reading or writing to the stack or heap) in an invalid way which results in undefined behavior.” The goal of an attacker is to exploit this undefined behavior or state to their advantage. This is often possible when a program expects some kind of input from a user and has not properly protected against malicious input. There are several types of weaknesses that might allow this type of attack including: Lifetime control, uninitialized memory, array index calculations, buffer length calculations (see more at http://cwe.mitre.org/). </p>

		<p>With memory corruption attacks it is not always necessary to have code execute in the payload. For example, when overwriting a buffer it is possible to alter other areas of memory, like variables that may influence the program behavior or return addresses, etc. In order to perform these types of attacks it is important to understand the structure of the stack in memory and exactly how many bytes are between the end of the buffer the attacker has access to and the point in memory they wish to overwrite. It is possible to put executable code on the stack using the buffer overflow method. Modern OS’s are able to mitigate this type of attack, so there are now better ways to get malicious code executed.</p>

		<p>One type of memory corruption attack is to overflow a buffer with an enormous amount of data that fills the entire stack. Then use WinDbg to determine the offset of the return address. Store the malicious shell code in memory and determine the address, then overwrite the return address with the address of the shell code. Another type of attack is called a “trampoline” attack where the attacker finds a module loaded at a static address and finds “jmp esp” command somewhere in the memory space (within another command). Then by positioning the shell code payload after esp the attacker can invoke the jmp esp command and cause the shell code to be executed. </p>
